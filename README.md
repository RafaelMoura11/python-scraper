# Python Scraper

The Python Scraper Project was a challenge created by the Web Development Course [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). There were 11 empty functions to be implemented. The whole project is intended to scrape data from a website and insert them into the database MongoDB

Both MongoDB and Docker files were already provided by Trybe and my role was to make what they demanded

To make sure that they were working rightly, I had to test them using Trybe test files which were provided by them as well

Once I got through those 11 challenges I was finally approved in this project
